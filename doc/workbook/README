To get this to work, you will need the following:

1.  Version 1.4.1 of Ant.  You should install it so you can run it from
 any command line.
2.  Version 2.3.1 of Xalan with all the jars that comes with it in the.
 ./lib directory.
3.  Type ./ant and you should see a bunch of xslt process messages.
4.  Now go look in the ./html directory for the stuff.


TODO

*  Need to create an XML and XSLT that will make the frame and index page.
*  Migrate to Styler instead of Style
