<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following are detailed views of each screen and short descriptions of what they do.  Before you begin, please
	try to download the working interface demo that we have <a href="/eece/chat.tar.gz">here</a> and run it.  You need
	<b>Linux</b> and <b><a href="http://www.fltk.org">FLTK</a></b> if you wish to compile it.  If you simply want to run it, 
	then go into the src directory and run the "chat" program that is there.  It should run as it is statically linked.</p>
<h3>Main Screen</h3>
<img src="images/main_screen.png" border="0"><p>The main screen is a standard chat looking screen, but is connected to channels on servers.  The view you are
	currently seeing is of a fake channel with an imaginary chatter called "agent" and myself "zedshaw".  The main
	window has menus across the top for the common actions that you can perform, along with different subtle
	interactions that the user can do.  For example, the "Chat With" button above the list of users to the right lets
	users select a people from the chat window or the user list window and break of either a private chat or a focused
	chat with those individuals.  This is similar to walking up to specific individuals in a large room full of people
	and talking to just them.</p>
<h3>Connecting To Servers</h3>
<img src="images/connect_screen.png" border="0"><p>Users will be able to connect to servers easily by having their most frequently accessed servers at the top of
	the list, and the ability to search for servers using the input field at the top.</p>
<h3>Mini Chat Screen</h3>
<img src="images/mini_chat_screen.png" border="0"><p>While the Main Screen is open, the user can select individuals (or small groups) to chat with either privately or
	focused.  A private chat is one that separates the users from the rest of the group and allows them to chat
	independently of others.  A <i>focused</i> chat is where the chat recipients are still chatting in the main channel, but the
	the user has "broken" them out of the room so that she can focus on what they are saying.  Focused chat is basically the
	ability to narrow the set of people needed to concentrate on for conversation.  The recipients of the chat would not
	know any differently, as it is just an interface item.</p>
<h3>Agent Chat Screen</h3>
<img src="images/agent_chat_screen.png" border="0"><p>To simplify interaction with agents, we have users "chat" with them just like regular people.  The agent chat
	window looks the same as regular chat, and the user answers questions of the agent and reads responses.  The user is
	also able to combine agents and have them work cooperatively, just like combining multiple chats into one from the
	Mini Chat Screen.  Agents will also be able to alter the Agent Chat Screen interface slightly to produce GUI widgets
	for users to interact with.  This is desired since it is sometimes difficult to get certain information from users 
	with just textual information.</p>
<h3>Save/Restore Previous Workspaces</h3>
<img src="images/save_work_screen.png" border="0"><p>
<img src="images/restore_work_screen.png" border="0"></p>
<p>One common activity in most IRC chat systems (and most IM chat systems) is to write scripts that will
	automatically connect to favorite servers and join favorite channels.  Since regular users have difficulty writing
	these scripts, we have opted for a "workspace" system.  The last workspace the user used will be loaded, and they
	can quickly switch to other workspaces by simply loading them.  This lets them easily setup nice connections and
	favorite channels without the need to learn scripting languages.</p>
<h3>Change Nickname</h3>
<img src="images/set_nick_screen.png" border="0"><img src="images/set_nick_done_screen.png" border="0"><p>Right now we have just the rudimentary functionality for the different preferences users are normally able to set
	in the chat environment.  One of the interesting things of IRC chat style systems (and SILC by extension) is that
	they allow the user to simply change their nickname at will.  This is such a common activity that we decided to add
	it to the prototype for completeness.  The final product will have a more extensive set of common actions and a
	complete preferences screen with expert options and controls.</p>
<h3>Joining, Making New, and Browsing Channels</h3>
<img src="images/join_screen.png" border="0"><p>Users will have much more flexibility in finding channels they are interested in.  They will be able to sort the
	channels however they like, do searches, and select multiple channels to join.  The sorting capabilities will most
	likely be:  By Popularity, By Population, By Activity, and By Favorite.</p>
<img src="images/make_new_screen.png" border="0"><p>In regular IRC and SILC chat, users can join channels that do not exist and they are created.  This double use of
	the join capability (join and create) causes people confusion since they either look for a "new" capability, or
	accidentally spell a channel incorrectly and believe they are in a channel with 0 people (because they just created
	it).  Because of this, we decided to separate creation of channels from joining channels.  In the protocol, they
	will be the same, but the user's interface will separate it for clarity.</p>
<img src="images/browse_chan_screen.png" border="0"><p>This window is intended to possibly be open all the time so that users can monitor favorite channels for
	activity.  It basically lets the user select a few channels (as many as the server allows) and have their contents,
	activity levels, and a set of keywords discussed displayed.  This way, the user can get a quick view of a few
	channels, effectively "joining" them, but not having to focus on them for chat.  If they desire, they can
	temporarily switch to a channel that interests them in the browser.  This action would minimize their current
	windows (not closing them) and open a chat in the new channel.  With the browser constantly open, the user can
	easily switch around from channel to channel.  Optionally, they could have the browser simply open new channels.
	This feature may just replace the Join Channel feature if we find that it is redundant.</p>
<p>This concludes the description of most of the screens we currently have.  Please download the functional demo as
	mentioned at the begining of this document.</p>
