<p>The Screen Design Standards Prototyping is where we prototype the interface based on the 
	screen design standards.</p>
<p>The current set of widgets described in the <a href="Conceptual_Model_Design.html">
		Conceptual Model Design</a> were designed well enough that we don't need to enhance them anymore in this phase.
		What is needed at this point is how these different screens will interact with each other.  Therefore, below is
		a set of state diagrams showing the general flow of screens based on different use actions.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/screen-flow.png"></p>
<p>This diagram shows how users will move from window to window during operation.  As you can see, the chat window
	is the center of all the action, except when the application first starts.  The application shows the connect window
	at first so the user can select where they want to connect to initially.  Upon connection, the user is prompted with
	the list of channels so they can select an initial channel.  After than, all interaction is done through the Chat
	window menus.</p>
<p>Each window is started by a menu from the menu bar, and do not interfere with other windows.  This means that, if
	the user wants to connect to a new channel, it will start up the JoinChannel window without closing the current
	channel.  When they select a channel form JoinChannel, a new Chat window is started without closing the previous
	one.</p>
<p>When all Chat windows are closed (thus, leaving all channels), the JoinChannel window is shown so the user can
	pick a new channel.  If the user logs off of the server, then the Connect window is shown.  When the user wants to
	quit, they will simply select the "Exit" option from the "File" menu.</p>
