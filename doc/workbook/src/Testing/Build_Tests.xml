	<h4>abstract</h4>
	<p>This document describes the tests performed to assure that the
	build environment fits the requirements needed for properly building
	and running WebScarab.
	</p>
	<h4>description</h4>
	<p>
	The build processes is based on apache jakarta's ant.<br />
	All production releases will contain a minimal ant installation
	that can be started via shell scripts (configure.sh or configure.bat).<br />
	The minimal ant installation will only be used to perform the two
	basic tests:
	<ul>
		<li>check for sun jdk 1.4 or higher</li>
		<li>check for apache jakarta ant 1.4.1 or higher</li>
	</ul>
	All following tests require these two basic tests to be passed.<br />
	If one of them fails, building and running WebScarab is considered to be
	impossible.<br />
	The configure process will check for the existence of the following
	<b>mandatory</b> packages:
	<ul>
		<li>Xerces-J-src-2.0.1.zip</li>
		<li>rhino15R3.zip</li>
	</ul>
	If one of these tests fails, WebScarab cannot be built and run.<br />
	On a platform that passes the first four tests, WebScarab can be
	built an run without access to unit tests, UML design scheme and
	docbook whitepapers.<br /><br />
	
	To get access to the full WebScarab specs, docs and unit tests,
	these additional packages have to be installed:
	<ul>
    <li>xalan-j_2_3_1-src.tar.gz</li>
    <li>junit3.7.zip</li>
    <li>junitperf1.8.zip</li>
    <li>jdepend2.2.zip</li>
    <li>either argo-0.9.7.tar.gz or PoseidonCE-1.2.1.zip</li>
	</ul>
	If one of the tests fails, the user will be informed what part of
	WebScarab cannot be rebuilt, will be advised to install the
	lacking packages and will be told where to get them.
