		<h4>abstract</h4>
		<p>This document describes how the WebScarab source code
		functionality is hedged by unit tests.</p>
		<h4>description</h4>
		<p>
		To build a complete Suite of unit tests for the WebScarab
		source code, the <a href="http://www.junit.org">junit framework</a>
		(http://www.junit.org) will be used.<br />
		To ensure the package dependency structure, jdepend 
		will be plugged into the junit test suite.
		For load and performance testing the junit extension
		junitperf will be used.<br />
		Both of these extensions are available under the GPL at
		<a href="http://www.clarkware.com">clarkware</a>.<br />
		A class is considered to have a complete unit test suite,
		if and only if at least for every public method (aka "interface")
		and for every public constructor exists a test that defines
		and tests the aspired behaviour of that method/ctor.<br />
		Every production release must have a complete unit test suite
		for every non-abstract class. No test is allowed to fail
		within production releases.<br />
		The test suites of a package always reside in a direct subpackage
		called ...test (e.g. org.owasp.webscarab.util -&gt; org.owasp.webscarab.util.test).<br />
		All test suites are connected in a test tree, such that a test
		for a subpackage can be run separately, but that testing a package
		always includes testing all of it's subpackages.<br />
		For each package exists a test suite class called [package].test.Suite.<br />
		For each class exists a test class called [package].test.[class]Test.<br />
