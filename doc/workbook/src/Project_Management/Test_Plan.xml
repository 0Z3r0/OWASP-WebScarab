  <p>Because of the high security of the project, and the high profile of the site 
	it is associated with (<a href="http://www.owasp.org">OWASP</a>) it must be very
	well tested to avoid embarassment,  The following test types should be done
	for the project:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Unit Tests -- These are probably the most important tests, as they will ensure the 
	integrity of the project as various people work on it in distant locations.</li>
	<li>Build Tests -- No matter how hard you try, everyone has a different environment.
	These tests ensure that people are developing with the same set of libraries and
	other build tools and requirements.  Basically, it is a sanity check for potential 
	developers who want to build the project.</li>
	<li>Install Tests -- This verifies that the final installation works on all planned
	platforms.</li>
	<li>User Interface Tests -- These verify that the user interface works as expected for 
	the users.  This might be difficult as there aren't many users to work with.
	Cognitive walkthrough and hueristic analysis will probably work better for these.</li>
	<li>Black Box Tests -- Not sure if black box tests are necessary, but it might be nice
	to have some automated tests of all the dialogs to make sure that it works as expected.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The primary tests are the Unit Tests, as these will ensure the greatest integrity.
	The other tests check various things that the Unit Tests cannot directly verify.</p>
