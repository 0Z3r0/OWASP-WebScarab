    <p>Following the Non-functional Requirements and the different Use Cases, we have this diagram as our initial
	<b>Conceptual Model Design</b>:</p>
	
	<img src="images/conceptual_model_diagram.png" border="0"/>
	
	<p>This diagram quickly shows the most important screens that the user will encounter, and some possible paths to
	these screens.  Most of the interaction is not currently visible from this diagram (nor, will it be since the
	diagram is static), but you can get an idea of the conceptual design of the interface.</p>
	
	<p>First, keep in mind that this is a rough prototype that we have running on Linux currently.  You can download a
	copy of the code <a href="/eece/chat.tar.gz">here</a>.  At this time, it does not have the concept of a "canvas",
	and just creates multiple windows using the operating system.  This is much simpler to implement, and seemed the way
	to go for such a small prototype.</p>
	
	<p>Second, many details of the interaction are not completely worked out.  For example, the ability to change your
	nickname should also be accompanied by an extensive preferences screen.  Also, there is not expert menu for those
	familiar with IRC already.</p>
	
	<p>Finally, the agent chat capability is not really apparent until you "play" with it.  Right now it just looks like
	a regular window, and we suspect this will be the power of the agents.  They will interact with the user the same
	way as regular individuals.  Some interesting research opportunities come out of this, which we will explore during
	development and testing.</p>
	
	<p>For a complete description of each screen, please download the prototype, compile it (you'll need windows) or run
	the pre-compiled binary (hopefully it works) and follow the <b>Conceptual Model Design Mock-ups</b> (to the right). 
	That document describes each screen in relative detail.</p>
	
	<p>One final word:  We have not tested this interface with users yet.  We have to still get human subjects approval
	before conducting any usability testing, so we are simply designing what might work.  Later we will test the
	interface with the users.</p>
