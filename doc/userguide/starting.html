<html><body><h1>Starting WebScarab</H1>

<p>On Windows, if you have installed the JRE, you should be able to run WebScarab simply by double-clicking on it. You should also be able to do this on MacOS X, and you <b>MAY</b> be able to do this on some Unix or Linux systems. However, as WebScarab is still not entirely stable, you may encounter unhandled exceptions, which cause WebScarab to behave incorrectly.</p>
<p>Because of this, I strongly recommend that you run WebScarab from a terminal window (CMD.exe for Windows, your preferred shell on Unix), using the following command:</p>
<pre>
java -jar webscarab-release.jar [sessiondir]
<pre>
<p>where "release" above will change according to the release date of the file, and [sessiondir] is an optional parameter which will tell WebScarab to load an existing session from that directory, or to use that directory to store a new session. WebScarab will create the directory (and any intermediate directories) if it does not exist.</p>
<p>Running WebScarab in a terminal window will allow you to see any stack traces that occur, and, more importantly, send them to the OWASP WebScarab mailling list at sourceforge.net, where we can attempt to do something about them.</p>
