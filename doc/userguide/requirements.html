<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>WebScarab requires v1.4.2 or higher of the <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java
Runtime Environment</a>, due to use of 1.4.2 specific features, such as
the JSSE, and also other functions such as String.split();</p>
<p>If you intend to modify WebScarab and rebuild it, you will need an
appropriate SDK, as well as ANT. You can get ANT from the Apache
project. All the other necessary libraries are checked in to the Sourceforge CVS servers, so if you check out the source, you should have all you need to get started with WebScarab.</p>
<p>There are ant taks using IzPack or ProGuard to create distributable archives. The IzPack method is deprecated, and will be suffering from bit-rot. If you want to build distributable's, you should get ProGuard, and use that.</p>
