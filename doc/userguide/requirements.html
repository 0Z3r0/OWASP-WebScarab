<h1>Requirements</h1>
WebScarab requires v1.4 or higher of the <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java
Runtime Environment</a>, due to use of 1.4 specific features, such as
the JSSE, and also other functions such as String.split();
<p>If you intend to modify WebScarab and rebuild it, you will need an
appropriate SDK, as well as ANT. You can get ANT from the Apache
project.</p>
