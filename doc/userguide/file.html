<html><body><h1>The File menu</h1>

The File menu is pretty self explanatory:</p>

<ul>
<li>New saves and flushes any existing session data, then prompts for a new session directory to create a new session in. </li>
<li>Open is similar, except that it expects an existing session to be opened. </li>
<li>Exit saves any session data that has not yet been saved (if a session directory has been specified), and exits.
