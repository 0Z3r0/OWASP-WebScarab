<html><body><h1>Using WebScarab</h1>

On running WebScarab, you will see a number of menu options, several tabs, and two windows at the bottom, labeled stdout and stderr. These windows can be resized (vertically and horizontally), and will show various messages while WebScarab is running. Since WebScarab is still in development, it is a good idea to keep an eye on these messages, especially if there is a sudden loss of functionality. You may find a stacktrace or other message that would indicate why.
