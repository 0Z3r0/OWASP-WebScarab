<h1>Installing WebScarab</h1>
<p>The latest stable release of WebScarab is always available from the <a
 href="http://www.owasp.org">OWASP</a> <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424&amp;package_id=61823">download
page at SourceForge.net</a>. Sometimes, an unstable testing release may be posted at <a href="http://dawes.za.net/rogan/webscarab">this site</a> for broader testing.</p>
<p>Previous releases of WebScarab were distributed as an installer, which, when run, extracted the necessary files to a directory, and on Windows platforms, created shortcuts and menu entries. In an effort to reduce complexity (and the download size!), WebScarab is now distributed as an entirely self-contained jar, which needs no installation at all.</p>

<p>One downside of this new distribution method is that the source code is no longer included in the distributed file. If there is demand for it, I will make source tarballs available for download at the same time as the compiled executable. Let me know if this is an issue for you. Otherwise, the source can always be retrieved from the SourceForge CVS servers.</p> 
<p>If you intend to modify the sources and rebuild, it is not recommended to check them out into a directory that contains spaces, as the build system (ant) does not handle this very well. On win32, I suggest using a directory immediately off the root, e.g. C:\WebScarab.</p>
