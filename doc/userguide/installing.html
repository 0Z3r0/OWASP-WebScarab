<html><body><h1>Installing WebScarab</h1>

The latest version of WebScarab is always available from the <a href="http://www.owasp.org">OWASP</a> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424&package_id=61823">download page at SourceForge.net</a></P>
WebScarab comes packaged in a self-executing .jar that can install WebScarab into the appropriate places. The installer includes some obsolete design documentation, the source that was used to build WebScarab, as well as most library dependencies that WebScarab requires.</P>

The installer will try to install WebScarab into the "Program Files\WebScarab" directory on a Win32 platform, or into your home directory on a Unix platform. If you intend to modify the source and rebuild, it is not recommended to install into a directory that contains spaces, as the build system (ant) does not handle this very well. On win32, I suggest installing into a directory immediately off the root, e.g. C:\WebScarab.
