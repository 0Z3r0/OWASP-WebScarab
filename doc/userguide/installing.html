<h1>Installing WebScarab</h1>
<p>The latest version of WebScarab is always available from the <a
 href="http://www.owasp.org">OWASP</a> <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424&amp;package_id=61823">download
page at SourceForge.net</a>
WebScarab comes packaged in a self-executing .jar that can install
WebScarab into the appropriate places. The installer includes some
now-obsolete design documentation, the source that was used to build
WebScarab, as well as most library dependencies that WebScarab requires
to run.</p>
<p>The installer will try to install WebScarab into the "Program
Files\WebScarab" directory on a Win32 platform, or into your home
directory on a Unix platform. If you intend to modify the source and
rebuild, it is not recommended to install into a directory that
contains spaces, as the build system (ant) does not handle this very
well. On win32, I suggest installing into a directory immediately off
the root, e.g. C:\WebScarab.</p>
