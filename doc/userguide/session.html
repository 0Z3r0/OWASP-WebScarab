<h1>Specifying a session directory</h1>
<p>WebScarab normally prompts for a directory to save its session data
into. If you choose not to save your data, you will be unable to make
use of the "View details" or "View Scripts/comments" options, and you
will be unable to save your data at a later point. Opening a new
session discards any existing data already in memory. You will be able
to intercept and edit requests made through the proxy, and submit
manual requests, etc, but they will not be saved.</p>
<p>It is also possible to provide WebScarab with a directory to use for
session data when starting WebScarab. Simply pass the directory as the
first parameter on the command line. If the directory does not exist,
it will be created. If the directory does not contain an existing
session, you will be prompted to create a new one, otherwise the
session will be opened.</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<pre>webscarab.bat c:\temp\session\<br>./webscarab.sh /tmp/session/<br></pre>
<p>For some unknown reason, this only works under Unix, not Windows.
I'll fix this eventually.</p>
