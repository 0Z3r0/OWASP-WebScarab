<h1>Specifying a session directory</h1>
<p>WebScarab uses a temporary directory to store session data in it, if no session has been specified on the command line, and no other session has been created or opened. Data stored in this temporary directory will be deleted when WebScarab exits! If you want to retain the data for later review, make sure to create a new session directory explicitly. If you use the temporary session for some important conversations, you may be able to save it, by creating a new session, then going to whereever your system is configured to save temporary files (/tmp/ on Unix, somewhere under "Documents and Settings" on Win32), finding a directory named webscarab-xxxx, and copying/moving that directory to a more permanent location. DO NOT EXIT WebScarab until the copy has been completed, as the directory will be deleted on exit. Also, don't copy the data without opening a new (or existing) session first, as the act of creating a new session forces WebScarab to flush any data that is still in memory out to disk.</p>

<p>It is also possible to provide WebScarab with a directory to use for
session data when starting WebScarab. Simply pass the directory as the
first parameter on the command line. If the directory does not exist,
it will be created. If the directory does not contain an existing
session, a new one will be created in that directory, otherwise the
session will be opened.</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<pre>
java -jar webscarab.jar c:\temp\session\
java -jar webscarab.jar /tmp/session/
</pre>
