  This package provides the framework for examining Java code. 
  <p>
  The package <b><i>CodeSpy</i></b> implements rules in the 
  package <code>com.owasp.codespy.rule</code>. New rules can be added to this or
  another package and handled transparently by this framework as long as the
  rule implements the {@link com.owasp.codespy.Rule} interface. 
  <p>
  Reports can be produced in lots of ways by implementing the
  <code>com.owasp.CodeSpy.Report</code> interface. The reference implementation of
  this interface is {@link com.owasp.codespy.PrintReport} which can display the 
  report to the console.
  <p>
  A reference implementation of a complete audit based on the draft set of
  rules which were taken from <b><i>Securing Java by Felten and McGraw</b><i> (cause it was on my desk) 
  is {@link com.owasp.codespy.RunAudit}. These rules are just to demonstrate the concept !
