The spider subpackage of the WebScarab project is mainly built
as a successor of WebSPHINX version 0.4a.

Since WebSPHINX was developed for jdk 1.1 and with several
non-open-source libraries as prerequisite, the sources had to
be restructured and rewritten quite a bit.

Nevertheless, WebSPHINX is the base of this package and we
hereby want to express our gratitude to Robert C. Miller and
Krishna Barat, the authors of this spider library framework.
