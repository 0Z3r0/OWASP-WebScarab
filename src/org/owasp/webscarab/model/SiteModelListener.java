/**
 * Defines the interface required by classes wishing to listen to SiteModel events.
 *
 * NOTE: the SiteModel calls these methods while holding a read lock. This
 * means that any attempts to write to the model in the same thread will deadlock
 * immediately. These event methods should only be used to notify other threads
 * of changes, and should return pretty quickly.
 * It IS safe to perform reads from the model in this and other threads during
 * this method. The model allows multiple simultaneous readers, but only one writer.
