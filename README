This is the WebScarab OpenSource project, hosted at
http://www.owasp.org/webscarab.

It aims to become a tool that may be used automatically or interactively
to test web applications for their security.
WebScarab is written 100% pure java and built completely modularized
to easily enable the substition of one ore more of the components it
contains.

Basically WebScarab is divided into these parts:

   util - generic utility classes that may be useful for other purposes
          and that can be considered to be an extension of java.util
   data - datastore that is used by all other components; it provides
          persistent storage of all needed data as well as listener
          mechanisms for dynamic data exchange between the modules
 spider - a web spider that is used to retrieve targets to be attacked
analyse - analyzer that decides which attacks shall be executed
 attack - loads attack classes and performs the attacks in a secure
          sandbox
 proxy - a browser proxy to provide web access to the data
    ui - different user interfaces (xml-, text-reports, swing-ui)
