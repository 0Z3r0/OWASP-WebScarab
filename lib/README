This is a compilation of the prerequisite libraries and tools needed to
build and/or run WebScarab.
Everything needed is included in the single file optlib.jar.
If you want to exchange parts of it, please download the appropriate
packages from the cvs module extern or any later releases found at
the publisher's sites.

 file: junit3.7.zip
 what: java unit test suite framework
where: http://www.junit.org/
 note: We provide a junit-clean.jar since the original junit distro
       is severely broken (no proper/clean builds)

 file: jakarta-ant-1.4.1-src.tar.gz
 what: XML based build tool
where: http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/

 file: argo-0.9.7.tar.gz 
 what: OpenSource UML modelling tool
where: http://argouml.tigris.org/
 note: You may prefer to use Poseidon for UML that can be found in
       our external cvs module. If you do so you may remove argo,
			 since poseidon already contains a complete argo distribution.

 file: rhino15R3.zip 
 what: mozilla JavaScript package
where: http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/
